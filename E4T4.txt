1. What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet-facing attack surface of the web application instance.

Answer: Use AWS system manager to access the server to eliminate unnecessary interaction with the instance. 

2. Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.

Answer: No, this will not ensure the lest priviledge and cannot separate the free recipe bucket with secrets bucket

3. Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?

Answer: No, this will only encrypt new files. Existing ones need to be encrypted manually. 

4. The changes you made above were done through the console or CLI; describe the outcome if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment?

Answer: Via console. Risks that remediated will show up again as the change was not made to the templates.
